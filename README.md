# Professional Portfolio (June 2022)

## Description

Hi there! I am a full-stack web developer, fresh off the block, with proficiencies in HTML, CSS, Handlebars, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, MySQL and Sequelize. Check out a few of my latest applications:

1. **[What Kind of Pokémon Are You?](https://github.com/jazzberriess/collab-what-pkmn-are-you)**: A collaboration with fellow developers [Christi S](https://github.com/jazzberriess), [Vicky C](https://github.com/vicchyx), and [Glenn D](https://github.com/gd741). This is an interactive app that pairs players with a Pokémon according to the player's taste in music.
2. **[Book Nest](https://github.com/grace-anderson/book-nest)**: A collaboration with fellow developers [Helen A](https://github.com/grace-anderson), [Muhamad S](https://github.com/s3793758), and [Marko P](https://github.com/Marko-Petreski). This app allows users to browse through a library of books and select which ones to put on (or remove from) their reading list. Users are able to add titles to Book Nest to share them with others.
3. **[Tech Blog](https://github.com/AtlantaBlack/Tech_Blog)**: A blogging platform for developers to post their thoughts to like-minded individuals, and start conversations (through commenting) on blog posts made by others.
4. **[Team Profile Generator](https://github.com/AtlantaBlack/Team_Profile_Generator)**: An app that uses Node.js and the CLI to allow development team managers to generate their own (very nice-looking) webpage that contains info cards for each of their team members.
